An eidolon is a being formed of ephemeral essences—typically mind, life, or spirit—that needs your body and connection to this world to manifest.</p>\n<p>Choose what type of eidolon you have from the options beginning on page 18. In this playtest, the options available (and the spellcasting tradition each option grants you) are angel (divine), beast (primal), devotion phantom (occult), and dragon (arcane). When you choose your eidolon, you also determine their appearance and general form within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon’s type and general appearance, these features can’t later be changed.</p>\n<p>The link between you and your eidolon takes the form of a magic glowing sigil on each of your bodies. This symbol can’t be obscured either magically or via mundane means, as it either shines through the magic or appears over top of whatever you use to cover it. This sigil, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you have some connection with each other, even if that onlooker doesn’t know what a summoner or an eidolon is.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion; the two of you share the same life force and work together as equals. You and your eidolon share your actions, your Hit Points, and your multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions and reaction for yourself or your eidolon. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you restores your Hit Points. If you or your eidolon is affected by anything that would change a creature’s actions, it affects your shared actions. In any case, if you are both subject to the same effect, you take the effects only once (applying the worse effect, if applicable).</p>\n<p>For instance, if you and your eidolon are caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies. Similarly, if you or your eidolon is slowed, you would start your turn with fewer actions, but even if you were both slowed, it wouldn’t increase the effect. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon slowed 2, you’d have 2 fewer actions because that’s the more severe effect.</p>\n<p>This life link doubles as a conduit that allows you to manifest your eidolon in this world. You gain the Manifest Eidolon activity, allowing you to make your eidolon appear at your side.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon doesn’t have the summoned or minion trait, but the conduit that allows them to manifest is also a tether between you. They must remain within 100 feet of you at all times and can’t willingly go beyond that limit. If forced beyond this distance, or if you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points, your eidolon’s physical form dissolves, and you need to use Manifest Eidolon to manifest them again.</p>\n<p>Your connection also allows you to communicate with your eidolon telepathically at all times, even when they aren’t manifested. This ability lets you coordinate your actions with your eidolon to accomplish more than either of you could alone. You gain the Act Together and Share Senses actions.</p>\n<p>While your eidolon can’t wear or use magic items except for companion items that specifically mention that they work for eidolons, their connection to you means they benefit from certain items once you invest in those items. Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items you’ve invested, as well as the benefits of the potency and resilient runes on your armor or the item bonuses of any bracers of armor you’ve invested. Your eidolon benefits from the potency, striking, and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows, and you can Invest a single magic weapon to share the benefits of those runes from the weapon as well, even though you normally can’t Invest a magic weapon.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"rarity":{"value":"common"},"usage":{"value":"held-in-one-hand"},"rules":[],"level":{"value":"1"},"featType":{"value":"classfeature"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":""},"prerequisites":{"value":""}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"98EnddCF3uFySUNR"}
